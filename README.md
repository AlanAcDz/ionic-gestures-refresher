## Code reproduction for an issue with Ionic's gestures & refresher

This was created with the Ionic CLI using tabs template:
- Tab 1 shows how the gestures do not work if a refresher is present
- Tab 2 shows that the gestures work if no refresher is there

The gesture shown here was created as an Angular Directive

To run the app:
```
npm install

ionic serve
```
